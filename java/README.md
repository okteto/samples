# Java Sample App

This example shows how to leverage [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) to develop a Java Sample App directly in the cloud. The Java Sample App is deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests. It's based on [Spring's gs-rest-service example](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service).

Okteto works in any Kubernetes cluster by reading your local Kubernetes credentials. For a empowered experience, follow this [guide](https://okteto.com/docs/samples/java/) to deploy the Java Sample App in [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com), a free-trial Kubernetes cluster.


## Step 1: Install the Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI by following our [installation guides](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/blob/master/docs/installation.md).


## Step 2: Deploy the Java Sample App

Clone the repository and go to the java-kubectl folder.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/samples
$ cd samples/java
```

Deploy the Java Sample App by using the following command:
```console
$ kubectl apply -f manifests
deployment.apps "payroll" created
service "payroll" created
```

## Step 3: Create your Okteto Environment

In order to activate your Cloud Native Development, execute:

```console
$ okteto up
 ✓  Okteto Environment activated
 ✓  Files synchronized
 ✓  Your Okteto Environment is ready
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      payroll
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080


Welcome to Gradle 5.1.1!
...
```

The `okteto up` command will start a remote development environment that automatically synchronizes and applies your code changes without rebuilding containers (eliminating the **docker build/push/pull/redeploy** cycle). 

This development environment includes java dev tools (e.g. gradle) and it's configured to automatically start the application by running `gradle bootRun`, configured to reload the process after a successful compilation.  It will also start forwarding port 8080 to your local machine.

Verify that everything is up and running by calling the `/employees` endpoint from your local machine:
```console
$ curl http://localhost:8080/employees
```

The response to a successful request is a list of employees:
```json
[
    {"id":1,"name":"Pablo Chico de Guzman"},{"id":2,"name":"Ramon Lamana"},
    {"id":3,"name":"Ramiro Berrelleza"},{"id":4,"name":"Cindy Lopez"}
]
```

You can also get a single employee by passing an employee ID:
```console
$ curl http://localhost:8080/employees/4
```
```json
{
    "id":4,
    "name":"Cindy Lopez"
}
```

## Step 4: Develop directly in the cloud

 Time to write some code. Let's say that the company just hired employee #5, and you're tasked with adding her to the employee list. First, we'll check and see if someone else already took care of the work by calling the API:

 ```console
curl http://localhost:8080/employees/5
```
```json
{
    "timestamp":"2019-01-12T04:36:29.225+0000",
    "status":404,
    "error":"Not Found",
    "message":"employee not found",
    "path":"/employees/5"
}
```
 
 Alright, the new employee is not yet in the system. Open [payroll/src/main/java/payroll/PayrollController.java](payroll/src/main/java/payroll/PayrollController.java) with your favorite IDE. Add the new employee to the list (look around line 20) and save your changes.
 ```java
 ...
    this.employees.put(4, new Employee(4, "Cindy Lopez"));
    this.employees.put(5, new Employee(5, "Alexandra Greyson"));
...
 ```

Open a second terminal in the same folder, and compile your new code with the command below. This command will compile the code directly in the Okteto development, so we can benefit from the gradle's hot reloading capabilities:

```console
$ okteto exec -- gradle build
```

 Go back to your terminal and call API again:
```console
curl http://localhost:8080/employees/5
```
```json
{
    "id":5,
    "name":"Alexandra Greyson"
}
```

Your changes were automatically applied, no docker, kubectl or even a local jvm required 💪!

## Step 5: Cleanup

Cancel the `okteto up` command by pressing `ctrl + c` and run the following command to remove the resources created by this guide: 

```console
$ okteto down -v
 ✓  Okteto Environment deactivated
 
```

```console
$ kubectl delete -f manifests
deployment.apps "payroll" deleted
service "payroll" deleted
```
